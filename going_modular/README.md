# PyTorch Going Modular

This directory contains all the necessary materials for designing pytorch networks in a modular fashion.

They breakdown as follows:
* `going_modular/` - directory of Python helper scripts for running PyTorch code
* `models/` - trained PyTorch models that come as a result of running a notebook
For this section, we're going to see how the Part 1 notebook (cell mode) turns into the Part 2 notebook (script mode).

Doing this will result in us having a directory with the same structure as the `going_modular/` directory above.
