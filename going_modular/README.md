# PyTorch Going Modular

This directory contains all the necessary materials for designing pytorch networks in a modular fashion.

They breakdown as follows:
* `going_modular/` - directory of Python helper scripts for running PyTorch code
* `models/` - trained PyTorch models that come as a result of running a notebook
